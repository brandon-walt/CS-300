# CS-300


- The problem I was solving in the projects for this course was creating a program that allowed a user to sort, search, and print course information through the use of a menu.


- I approached the problem by first identifying which data structure is appropriate to store the course information from the provided CSV file. Then I identified which algorithms would be appropriate for the problem I was trying to solve and implemented them. 


- I overcame any roadblocks I encountered while going through the activities or project by reviewing any resources provided by this course or furthering my understanding by watching online videos about the roadblock I was struggling with.


- My work on this project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by allowing me to understand and identify which data structure is appropriate for the problem I am solving, and also which algorithms are most efficient when using that data structure.


- My work on this project evolved the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by showing me how implement proper algorithms to work with various data structures.
